Alembic provides for the creation, management, and invocation of change management scripts
for a relational database, using SQLAlchemy as the underlying engine.

This directory is the home of the migration environment.

 - alembic.ini:

     Configuration file that the alembic script looks for when invoked.

 - env.py:

    This is a Python script that is run whenever the alembic migration tool is invoked. At the very least, it contains
    instructions to configure and generate a SQLAlchemy engine, procure a connection from that engine along with a
    transaction, and then invoke the migration engine, using the connection as a source of database connectivity.

 - script.py.mako:

     This is a Mako template file which is used to generate new migration scripts. Whatever is here is used to generate
     new files within versions/. This is scriptable so that the structure of each migration file can be controlled,
     including standard imports to be within each, as well as changes to the structure of the upgrade() and downgrade()
     functions. For example, the multidb environment allows for multiple functions to be generated using a naming
     scheme upgrade_engine1(), upgrade_engine2().

 - versions:

    This directory holds the individual version scripts. the files here use a partial GUID approach.
